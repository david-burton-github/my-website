        <h2>About the Project</h2>
        <p>
            The Fluids Laboratory for Aeronautical and Industrial Research (FLAIR) at Monash University has been leading the Australian Research Council (ARC) Linkage Project LP180100234, titled "Structural Reliability of Engineering Structures in Cyclonic Winds." Key contributors to this project include Professor Mark Thompson, David Burton, and Dr. Daniel Tudball Smith. Additionally, their collaborative efforts focus on enhancing the structural reliability of engineering structures subjected to cyclonic wind conditions, aiming to develop improved design guidelines and assessment methods for structures in cyclone-prone regions.
        </p>
        <p>
            This project addressed a critical need to improve the understanding and prediction of structural reliability for large, complex structures subjected to extreme cyclonic winds, such as those experienced in North Western Australia. Extreme wind events, with gust speeds exceeding 400 km/h, posed substantial challenges to both experimental and computational modeling due to the turbulent and convective mechanisms associated with these events. We focused on the aerodynamic forces induced on cylindrical structural elementsâ€”common in critical infrastructure such as natural gas extraction facilities, transmission towers, and wind turbines. These structures, often comprising open-frame configurations with large-diameter cylindrical members, experience complex aerodynamic interactions that were not well understood, particularly at the extreme Reynolds numbers characteristic of cyclonic events.

        <h2>The Influence of Surface Roughness on Postcritical Flow Over Circular Cylinders</h2>
        <p>
            In this study, we investigated how surface roughness affects the aerodynamic behavior of circular cylinders in the postcritical flow regime, where drag forces stabilize and vortex shedding patterns are re-established. Using wind tunnel experiments, we systematically varied roughness ratios and Reynolds numbers to analyze their impact on parameters such as base pressure coefficient, drag coefficient, Strouhal number, and lift coefficient fluctuations. Our results demonstrated that surface roughness alters flow separation and wake dynamics, leading to increased drag and changes in unsteady forces.
        </p>
        <p>
            These findings provide detailed quantitative data, advancing the understanding of aerodynamic behavior in extreme flow conditions and contributing to safer engineering designs.

        <h2>Post-Critical Flow Over Arrangements of Multiple Rough Cylinders</h2>
        <p>
            This paper explores the forces on arrangements of two, three, and four rough cylinders in postcritical flow regimes. Through wind tunnel experiments, we uncovered critical insights into how cylinder spacing and wind incidence angles affect aerodynamic behavior. The findings highlight distinct flow regimes based on spacing and offer valuable data for optimizing the design of complex cylindrical structures.

            This study investigates the aerodynamic interactions between two rough circular cylinders placed side by side in the postcritical flow regime. We focused on the effects of spacing and Reynolds number variations, finding significant interaction effects that altered drag and lift forces and wake dynamics.
